# Solid Principles
Conceptualised by Robert C Martin, SOLID principles are an object-oriented approach that are applied to software structure design. It ensures that the software is modular, easy to understand, debug and refactor.

The word SOLID is an acrynom for:
- [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/ramanks19/solid-principles/tree/main/1.%20Single%20Responsibility%20Principle)
- [Open Closed Principle](https://github.com/ramanks19/solid-principles/tree/main/2.%20Open%20Closed%20Principle)
- [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://github.com/ramanks19/solid-principles/tree/main/3.%20Liskov%20Substitution%20Principle)
- [Interface Segregation Principle](https://github.com/ramanks19/solid-principles/tree/main/4.%20Interface%20Segregation%20Principle)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/ramanks19/solid-principles/tree/main/5.%20Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle)


**All SOLID principles are intertwined and interdependents. These are most effective when combined together.**

If we donâ€™t follow SOLID Principles, we may encounter various problems during the development and maintenance of software, such as:
- Code Smells: Poor design choices result in code smells that are hard to understand and maintain.
- Tight Coupling: Code modules become interdependent and tightly coupled, making it challenging to modify, test, or reuse them.
- Scalability Issues: A tightly coupled codebase can be difficult to scale and may require significant resources for future modifications.
- Rigidity: A small change in the system results in a series of changes throughout the system. This makes it difficult to introduce new features or update existing ones.
- Difficulty in Testing: Tight coupling can lead to difficulty in writing unit tests for modules or systems.
- Maintenance Challenges: Maintenance and modification of the codebase may become challenging due to a lack of clarity, flexibility, and scalability.
- Reduced Code Reuse: Code that is tightly coupled is difficult to reuse in other systems or projects.

Following SOLID Principles helps us to:  
- Maintainability: The SOLID principles help in writing clean, modular, and well-organized code, which is easier to maintain and update.
- Reusability: By writing modular code, we can reuse components in different parts of the application, thus reducing code duplication and improving efficiency.
- Testability: SOLID principles promote writing code that is easier to test and debug.
- Flexibility: Code written following SOLID principles can be more easily modified or extended to meet new requirements.
- Scalability: SOLID principles can help in building systems that are scalable and can handle changes or growth in the future.
