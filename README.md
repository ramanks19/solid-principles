The word SOLID is an acrynom for:
- [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/ramanks19/solid-principles/tree/main/1.%20Single%20Responsibility%20Principle)
- [Open Closed Principle](https://github.com/ramanks19/solid-principles/tree/main/2.%20Open%20Closed%20Principle)
- [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://github.com/ramanks19/solid-principles/tree/main/3.%20Liskov%20Substitution%20Principle)
- [Interface Segregation Principle](https://github.com/ramanks19/solid-principles/tree/main/4.%20Interface%20Segregation%20Principle)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/ramanks19/solid-principles/tree/main/5.%20Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle)


**All SOLID principles are intertwined and interdependents. These are most effective when combined together.**
